                <p>I really like making things</p>
                <p>when I was a kid I wanted to grow up and build bridges</p>
                <p>I've spent more time playing soccer than anything else</p>
                <p>We played around North America</p>
                <p>I learned a lot about what it means to compete</p>
                <p>In high school I quit soccer for my robotics team</p>
                <p>I skipped class, stayed at school late, came in on weekends to play robots</p>
                <p>My grades suffered but nobody was having more fun than us</p>
                <p>We competed around North America</p>
                <p>I learned a lot from my friends</p>
                <p>Team 1241 gave me the foundation to start making things</p>
                <p>I studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Ottawa</p>
                <p>I learned that fluid mechanics is hard but not impossible</p>
                <p>Thermodynamics was my favourite class even though I did not do well in it</p>
                <p>Hanan Anis showed me what was possible through the Makerspace</p>
                <p>I realized I wanted to become an architect without going to architecture school</p>
                <p>I started making art</p>
                <p>After graduating I spent time designing furniture and lighting with Jeff Forrest at Stacklab</p>
                <p>We spun out a product line into its own business called Stackabl</p>
                <p>I was losing my spark</p>
                <p>I am currently working independently researching new technologies, and designing products</p>
                <p>I'm back to playing soccer regularly</p>
